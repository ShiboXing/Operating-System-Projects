## project 1
A snake game that runs on qemu, where snake body pixels are implemented by qemu syscalls. 

## project 2
A multi-threading traffic simulation thats uses fork and semaphores to perform context switch. The main driver randomly generates tasks on two queues that are executed simultaneously.

## project 3
A page memory simulation program written in python that emulates FIFO, NRU, CLOCK and OPT(farthest page first) virtual page scheduling algorithm.

## project 4
A file system built with fuse that uses contiguous block allocation and a bitmap. Its read and write syscalls are implemented.
